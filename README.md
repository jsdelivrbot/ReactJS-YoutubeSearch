## ReactJS YoutubeSearch Application

A ReactJS only application for searching videos on Youtube. You just have type anything in the input and the application will automatically make an API request and return the videos that match your input.

You can select a video from the video list on the right side, and it will appear in the center as an embbedded video, ready to play!

## Motivation

While studying ReactJS, a great way to practice and understand basic concepts is by doing a real project. Through the course of making this application, I was able to understandthe core concepts of React such as:

* class based components
* functional components
* state
* ES6 syntax
* props

## Tribute

This application it's part of Stephen Grider's course called 'Modern React with Redux'.
