## ReactJS Youtube Search App

A youtube search app made entirely with ReactJS for educational purposes only. You can type anything in the input and the app will automatically make an API request, retrieving the five best results that match your search terms. Also, you can play the video right there in the screen, through and embeddded video.

## Motivation

Through the process of making this app, I've learned so much about fundamentals of ReactJS such as:

* Class based functions x Functional based functions
* Components
* Props
* State
* Inheritance
* JSX
* Import and Export concepts

As my first ReactJS project, it was great being able to practice these core concepts.

## Tribute

This project was based on a Stephen Grider course named 'Modern React with Redux'. Also, the boilerplate structure was cloned from his github repository [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter)

Thank you Stephen!
