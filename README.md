## ReactJS Youtube Search App

A youtube search app made entirely with ReactJS for educational purposes only. You can type anything in the input and the app will automatically make an API request, retrieving the five best results that match your search terms. Also, you can play the video right there in the screen, through and embeddded video.

## How to run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can do this with your terminal or downloading a ZIP file.
  - If you choose the terminal way, you should click the **Clone or download** green button in this page, copy the url and in your terminal type: 'git clone pasteURL'

2. Now that you have the project in your local machine, go into the project's folder (through your terminal, by doing cd *project's path*) and run the command 'npm start'

3. By doing so, you will be able to run a local server, probably based on PORT 8080 (check your terminal). Then, you just have to go into any browser and type 'localhost:8080'

4. Hopefully you can see the application running :smile:

## Motivation

Through the process of making this app, I've learned so much about fundamentals of ReactJS such as:

* Class based functions x Functional based functions
* Components
* Props
* State
* Inheritance
* JSX
* Import and Export concepts

As my first ReactJS project, it was great being able to practice these core concepts.

## Tribute

This project was based on a Stephen Grider course named 'Modern React with Redux'. Also, the boilerplate structure was cloned from his github repository [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter)

Thank you Stephen!
